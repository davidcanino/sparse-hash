<h3>A simplified version of the <i>Google SparseHash Library</i></h3>

This repository contains the C++ code for a simplified porting of the formerly <A href="https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash"><i>Google SparseHash Library</i></A>.

<p>Specifically, its header-only code is basically the same as the original library, but the code is slightly reorganized in order to simplify its inclusion.
